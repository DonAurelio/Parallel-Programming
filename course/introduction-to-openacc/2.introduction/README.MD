# Introduction to GPU programming with OpenACC

## Objectives

- [x] Understand why GPU programming has become a disruptive technology.
- [x] Understand some differences between GPU and CPU hardware.
- [x] Advantages of OpenACC
- [ ] Running the first application in CPU and GPU.


## Introdution

You will run your first application in OpenACC in order to verify that everything is working correctly. In addition, you will identify some of the main characteristics on this type of applications (e.g.,directives).


## Exercise 1

Copy and paste the code from [this](https://github.com/rmfarber/ParallelProgrammingWithOpenACC/blob/master/Chapter01/accFill_ex1.cpp) link. Save it in a file called **accFill_ex1.cpp**. Read and try to understand what the code does. Ask quetions to your tutor.

## Exercise 2

Run the application **accFill_ex1.cpp**.

```bash
make run 
```

## Questions

* What happend with the execution time? 
* Which option works best? 
* Is the answer correct in each case?.
* Check the file *Optimizations.txt* an look at all the work the compiler does
