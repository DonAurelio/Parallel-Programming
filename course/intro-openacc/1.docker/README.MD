# Setting Up a Docker Container 

The practices of the course will be held on docker containers. Containers allows the isolation of each individual experiment or practice, i.e, if you have several proyects and each proyect has its own container the libraries of one does not conflict with the libaries of others and so on. Another goodness with using containers is that you can save your container and run it on any computer running a Linux like OS (*experimental reproducibility*).

## Requirements

* Linux like OS: preferably Ubuntu
* Nvidia GPU drivers: instalation guide for Ubuntu 18 con be found [here](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-the-nvidia-drivers-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux)
* Ubuntu distribution of Docker: docker.io
* Nvidia Docker: [nvidia-docker2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker), allows containers to access the GPU.
* Basic undertanding of C/C++ programming language.

## Checking requrements

If you run the following command

```bash
docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi
```
you will get further info about your GPU displayed by the container, as shown bellow.

```bash
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NVIDIA-SMI 390.48                 Driver Version: 390.48                    |

| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr. ECC |
| Fan  Temp  Perf  Pwr:Usage/Cap|         Memory-Usage | GPU-Util  Compute M. |

+-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
                                                                               
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Processes:                                                       GPU Memory |
|  GPU       PID   Type   Process name                             Usage      |
|=============================================================================|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
If you got and error or an empty table is possible your device is not being detected or your system does not meet all the requirements. Please check them again before continuing.

## Experimentation environment

To perform the practices we will use a container prepared with the PGI compiler. So we need to pull the required image from **Docker hub**

```bash
docker pull hopobcn/pgi-ce
``` 

That is all. You did not have to install the **PGI Compiler** or deal with libraries and binaries. Now you have a ready to user PGI Compiler. However, if you need more libraries to run your application you can look for an image that meet the libraries you need. Or you can take the PGI compiler image as base and intall other libraries. On the other hand, Docker hub provides ready to use images prepared by several peapole arround the world. All you have to do is to download the image and use it.

The PGI Compiler is a C/C++ compiler just like gcc (GNU compiler) or icc (Intel compiler). In particular, this container presents significant improvements regarding GPU computing with OpenACC compiler directives.

Open a new terminal and place it in the *Desktop* folder. Then create a new folder called *acc-course* and get into it.

```bash
cd /home/<your user name>/Desktop
mkdir acc-course
cd acc-course
```

Now we will create our first container or experimental environment.

```bash
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --name acc-course -v ${PWD}:/acc-course hopobcn/pgi-ce
```
*Voil√†*, now you are inside your container ready to do science.

```bash
root@9abe8758aa21:/#
```

Lets check the GPU feactures using the following command.

```bash
root@9abe8758aa21:/# pgaccelinfo
```

If all is working well the command will show you the features of your GPU. If that is not the case it will show you 

```bash
No accelerators found.
Try pgaccelinfo -v for more information
```
